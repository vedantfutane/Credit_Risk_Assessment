# Credit_Risk_Assessment
This project involves developing a data science model to predict whether a credit risk and loan application will be approved or not, and to analyze the associated credit risk as low, moderate, or high. The model will be built using historical loan application data, and the risk assessment will help lenders make informed decisions.
